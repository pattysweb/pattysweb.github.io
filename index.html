<h1>Let Me Introduce You to This World</h1>
<p> I see EDM as an art, an art that can change your life. I will say, EDM is not for everyone though. 
So if you're not interested in the music itself this website is not for you. I realized that those who do not 
like the music, go into the rave scene for the wrong purpose. That wrong purpose is drugs and I want people to 
steer away from this crowd. So Welcome!</p>
