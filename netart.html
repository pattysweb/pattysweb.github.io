  <p class="text-center" style="border:2px solid Violet;">In this project, our assignment asked us to hand code a website from scratch. We had to construct a website that involved something in our life today or something that was going on with the world today. I decided to base my website on the EDM culture since it recently changed my life in a positive way. It still has an impact and the purpose behind it was to show others how it can do the same for you. I would say this website is mostly for those who are genuinely interested in the music and want to know what to expect when it comes to their first rave.

This website is very simple since I'm barely learning how to hand code, but eventually I will learn how to properly format. Click below to redirect to my website. :)
