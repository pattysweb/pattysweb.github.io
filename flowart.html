<h1>DIMENSION 3: THESE ACTIVITIES ADD TO THE EXPERIENCE</h1>
<p>Dancing is definitely one of the activities, but ravers have found a way to make the experience a bit more enhanced and that's
with flow art. It's kind of like dancing, but with hands. Not everyone is into this, but they either like to do a show or enjoy it.
I love to work with these lights, especially the LED whip. I gloved for a bit, but the whip has my heart. (No not that kind of whip)
We flow artists, love to find creative ways to make the show a part of your unforgettable experience. </p>

<h2> The Space Saber : This one is the newest type of flow art. Has an interesting concept to it and literally looks like you're
levitating a wand
