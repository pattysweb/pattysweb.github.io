  <p class="text-center" style="border:2px solid Violet;">This project was definitely another one of my favorites, I mean how could you go wrong with building art on a video game? I've never played Minecraft before, so it was a bit difficult at first to build things and a bit frustrating since it wasn't in creative mode. Nothing to complain about since our homework was literally done on a game.

We were asked to build something that is culturally significant and Snapchat per say, has a huge impact on our society. Social media in general, but I used the Snapchat logo since it is one of the most popular applications used. You can't say that apps like these dont have some sort of control in our lives. </p>
