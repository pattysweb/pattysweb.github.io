<h1>DIMENSION 4: OTHER RAVERS EXPERIENCE </h1>
<p>Ever since I started raving, it changed my life in many positive ways. I've always been shy since I was in highschool, but it boosted my confidence
to just talk to others since everyone loves making friends with one another at these raves. I will say, when I first started raving... I did do a bit of drugs & 
went through a bit of a fase. Fortunately that fase has ended because I know what's best for me. I also knew I didn't need it to enjoy 
these raves! As I've mentioned before, it's more than just the drugs. A lot of people who rave now, go solely for that purpose... but I wan't
to show others that it shouldn't be that way and it's not the only way. You want to be able to actually enjoy the music and have fun without the need of a substance. </p>
